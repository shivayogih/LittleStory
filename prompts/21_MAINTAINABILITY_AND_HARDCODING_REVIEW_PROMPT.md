# 21 — Maintainability and hardcoding review

**Role:** Code Quality and Maintainability Reviewer.

**Use when:** reviewing a PR or module for hardcoded values, duplication and configuration placement.

## Project facts (verified in P0 discovery, 2026-10-29)

- Governing prompt: `prompts/00_MASTER_ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT.md`. If this prompt and the master differ, the master and the owner's explicit instructions win.
- Repository: `shivayogih/LittleStory`. Branch model: `main` (stable) ← `staging` (release candidate) ← `development` (integration, default, all PRs target it) ← `feature/LS-###-slug` / `fix/LS-###-slug` / `milestone/mN-slug`; `hotfix/slug` from `main`. See `docs/project-management/branching-strategy.md`. Verify branches exist before use.
- Design reference: `docs/design/LittleStory_Figma_Design_Details.md`, `docs/design/design-tokens.json`, `docs/design/screens/*.jpg` (18 screens, 22 states, extracted from the Figma Make prototype `2DYtUW39GtnsDpUd5jSu6x`). Agents cannot read the live Make file (risk R-23); never invent design details that are not in the design pack.
- Backlog: `docs/project-management/LittleStory_Jira_Backlog.xlsx` (sheets Backlog, Screens, Requirements, Test Cases, Dependencies, ADRs, Risks & Questions, Git-PR-CI, Translations, Dashboard).
- Languages: English (`en`, default and fallback, `res/values/`) and Kannada (`kn`, `res/values-kn/`). Future languages via resources + one `SupportedLanguage` registry entry + `locales_config.xml` only.
- Proposed modules (ADR-002, awaiting owner approval): `:app`, `build-logic`, `:core:designsystem`, `:core:ui`, `:core:common`, `:domain`, `:data`, `:feature:onboarding`, `:feature:home`, `:feature:discover`, `:feature:create`, `:feature:reader`, `:feature:library`, `:feature:settings`.
- Build environment: the Claude Code cloud workspace builds Android once its network policy allows `dl.google.com` and the SDK is installed (`docs/release/build-and-run.md` §5); GitHub Actions runs `./gradlew check assembleDebug` on every PR. Never report a check as passed unless it actually ran.
- Development happens on Windows and macOS: use `./gradlew <task>` on macOS/Linux and `gradlew.bat <task>` on Windows.

## Inputs

- `docs/architecture/configuration-and-constants.md`, `docs/architecture/how-to-change.md`
- Master §4.5

## Steps

1. Search the diff for string literals in composables, `Color(`/hex, `.dp`/`.sp` literals outside `:core:designsystem`, inline `TextStyle`, route strings, URLs, durations and numeric limits.
2. Check each value has exactly one home: strings → resources, design values → tokens, limits/timings/options → `AppConfig`, toggles → `FeatureFlags`, environment → `BuildConfig`, versions → `libs.versions.toml`, languages → `SupportedLanguage`.
3. Check mock content lives in `assets/mock/*.json`, never in composables or ViewModels.
4. Look for duplicated UI that should reuse a shared component.
5. Check `how-to-change.md` is updated when a new configurable value was added.
6. Where a value is unavoidable, require a named constant with a comment explaining why.

## Always forbidden

- Hardcoded user-facing text, raw colours, raw dimensions, inline text styles, magic numbers, hardcoded routes, URLs or configuration values in feature code. Use string resources (EN + KN), design-system tokens, typed navigation destinations, `AppConfig` / `FeatureFlags` and `BuildConfig`.
- Adding a string without both an English (`values/`) and a Kannada (`values-kn/`) value. Unverified Kannada is marked "Needs native review", never "Approved".
- English text in ViewModels, use cases or domain code (use `UiText` / typed errors).
- Real AI providers, backends, authentication, payments, analytics, TTS, remote notifications, runtime machine translation, unapproved permissions or SDKs (MVP boundary, master §4.3).
- Skipping an approval level. A Discovery · B Documentation · C Implementation · D Push/PR · E Merge (owner only) · F Release (owner only). One approval never implies the next.
- Pushing, opening a PR, merging, force-pushing, deploying or publishing without explicit authorization. Never merge your own PR or bypass required checks.
- Committing secrets, tokens, child data, `local.properties` or machine-specific paths.

## Required output

- Findings with file:line, the value, its correct home, severity

## Stop and ask the owner when

- Two authoritative sources conflict (owner instruction, approved requirements, design pack, ADRs).
- The design pack does not define a detail you need: record an open question instead of inventing it.
- The work needs an approval level that has not been granted.
- A required check cannot run in the current environment: report the exact blocker and stop claiming that check.
- Fixing a finding needs a new shared component or token: propose it rather than inventing it.
